            <h1 id="async">JavaScript Async</h1>
            <p>Asynchronous JavaScript allows your program to carry out tasks without halting the main thread.
                Essentially, it lets JavaScript manage time-consuming processes, such as retrieving data from an API or
                interacting with a database, without forcing the application to pause while waiting for those processes
                to finish. This is particularly valuable in web development, as it ensures that the user interface
                remains responsive and fluid, even while these operations run in the background.</p>
            <p>The key reason why asynchronous programming is essential is that JavaScript operates in a single-threaded
                environment, meaning it can handle only one task at a time. If a lengthy operation, such as fetching
                data, were done synchronously, it could cause the entire application to hang until the task is done. By
                using asynchronous techniques such as callbacks, promises, or async/await, JavaScript can offload these
                time-consuming tasks, allowing the main thread to continue executing other tasks smoothly</p>
            <p>For example: </p>

            <div class="box-code">
                <pre><code class="language-js">const name = "Val Jimenez";
const greeting = `Hello World, my name is ${name}!`;
console.log(greeting);
// "Hello World, my name is Val Jimenez!"
                </code></pre>
            </div>
            <p>In this code, it runs line by line. First it declares the variable <code>name</code>, then the variable
                <code>greeting</code> and finally
                it runs the <code>console.log</code>. The code runs line by line, one by one. This means that it is a
                <b>synchronous code</b>.
            </p>
            <p>Next, we will see the different ways to make the code <b>asynchronous</b>.</p>

            <h1 id="callback">Callback</h1>
            <p>A callback is a function passed into another function as an argument, which is then executed after the
                completion of a certain task. Callbacks are essential for handling asynchronous operations, allowing the
                program to continue executing other tasks while waiting for an operation to complete.</p>

            <p>Historically, callbacks were the primary way to manage asynchronous processes in JavaScript, especially
                for functions like making HTTP requests or performing file operations. However, they can lead to deeply
                nested code that is harder to read and maintainâ€”a problem often referred to as "callback hell."</p>

            <p>For example: </p>

            <div class="box-code">
                <pre><code class="language-js">
function doStep1(init, callback) {
    const result = init + 5;
    callback(result);
}
                  
function doStep2(init, callback) {
    const result = init * 2;
    callback(result);
}
                  
function doStep3(init, callback) {
    const result = init - 4;
    callback(result);
}
                  
function doOperation() {
    doStep1(0, (result1) => {
        doStep2(result1, (result2) => {
            doStep3(result2, (result3) => {
                console.log(`Final result: ${result3}`);
            });
        });
    });
}
                  
doOperation();
                  
                </code></pre>
            </div>

            <p>In this example, we have three functions: <code>doStep1</code>, <code>doStep2</code>, and
                <code>doStep3</code>, each of which performs a different operation on an initial value. The
                <code>doOperation</code> function calls these three functions in sequence, passing the result of each
                operation to the next function as a callback. This creates a chain of asynchronous operations that
                execute one after the other, with each operation depending on the result of the previous one.
            </p>

            <h1 id="promise">Promise</h1>
            <p>A Promise in JavaScript is an object that represents the result of an asynchronous operation, which may
                either succeed or fail. It simplifies working with asynchronous code, providing a cleaner alternative to
                nested callbacks (callback hell).</p>

            <p>Promises have three possible states:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Pending: </b>The operation is still in progress.</li>
                <li><b>Fulfilled: </b>The operation has completed successfully.</li>
                <li><b>Rejected: </b>The operation has failed.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The key methods used with Promises are:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><code>then()</code>: For handling the result when the Promise is fulfilled.</li>
                <li><code>catch()</code>: For handling any errors when the Promise is rejected.</li>
                <li><code>finally()</code>: Runs code once the Promise has either fulfilled or rejected, useful for
                    cleanup tasks.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>For example: </p>

            <div class="box-code">
                <pre><code class="language-js">
function simulateFetch() {
    return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
        console.log("Starting the fetch process...");
        setTimeout(() => {
            const success = true;
            if (success) {
                resolve("Data successfully retrieved!");
            } else {
                reject("Failed to fetch the data.");
            }
        }, 2000);
    });
}
                  
simulateFetch()
    .then((result) => {
        console.log(result);
    })
    .catch((error) => {
        console.error(error);
    })
    .finally(() => {
        console.log("Fetch operation complete.");
    });
                  
                </code></pre>
            </div>
            <p>In this example, the <code>simulateFetch</code> function returns a Promise that resolves after a 2-second
                delay. The <code>then</code> method is used to handle the successful result, while the
                <code>catch</code> method is used to handle any errors that occur. The <code>finally</code> method is
                called once the Promise has either fulfilled or rejected, allowing you to perform cleanup tasks or other
                operations that should run regardless of the outcome.
            </p>

            <h1 id="async-await">Async/Await</h1>
            <p>The <code>async</code> and <code>await</code> keywords provide a cleaner and more intuitive way to work
                with promises in
                JavaScript. With <code>async/await</code>, you can write asynchronous code that looks and behaves more
                like
                synchronous code, making it easier to read and maintain.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><code>async</code>: Declaring a function with <code>async</code> makes it return a Promise. Inside
                    an <code>async</code>
                    function, you can use <code>await</code> to pause the execution until the Promise is resolved or
                    rejected.</li>
                <li><code>await</code>: The <code>await</code> keyword is used to wait for a Promise to settle (either
                    resolved or rejected). It can only
                    be used inside an <code>async</code> function.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>For example: </p>
            <div class="box-code">
                <pre><code class="language-js">
function fetchData() {
    return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
        setTimeout(() => {
            const success = true;
            if (success) {
                resolve("Data retrieved successfully!");
            } else {
                reject("Error fetching data.");
            }
        }, 2000);
    });
}
                      
async function getData() {
    try {
        const result = await fetchData();
        console.log(result);
    } catch (error) {
        console.error(error);
    } finally {
        console.log("Fetch operation completed.");
    }
}
                      
getData();
                      
                </code></pre>
            </div>
            <p>In this example, the <code>fetchData</code> function returns a Promise that resolves after a 2-second
                delay. The <code>getData</code> function is declared as an <code>async</code> function, allowing it to
                use
                the <code>await</code> keyword to pause the execution until the Promise is resolved or rejected. The
                <code>try/catch</code> block is used to handle the result or any errors that occur, while the
                <code>finally</code> block is used to perform cleanup tasks or other operations that should run
                regardless
                of the outcome.
            </p>

            <h1 id="event-loop">Event Loop</h1>
            <p>The event loop is a core feature of JavaScript that manages the execution of asynchronous operations.
                JavaScript is single-threaded, meaning it can only process one task at a time. The event loop enables
                the language to handle multiple tasks by placing asynchronous operations (like <code>setTimeout</code>,
                Promises, or
                event listeners) into a message queue. Once the main call stack is empty, the event loop picks up tasks
                from the queue and processes them.</p>
            <p>For example: </p>

            <div class="box-code">
                <pre><code class="language-js">
console.log("Start");

setTimeout(() => {
  console.log("Timeout 1");
}, 1000);

setTimeout(() => {
  console.log("Timeout 2");
}, 0);

console.log("End");

                </code></pre>
            </div>
            <p>In this example, the code logs "Start" and "End" to the console, followed by two <code>setTimeout</code>
                functions. The first <code>setTimeout</code> has a delay of 1000 milliseconds, while the second has a
                delay of 0 milliseconds. Despite the second <code>setTimeout</code> having a shorter delay, it is logged
                after the first one. This is because the event loop processes tasks in the order they are added to the
                queue, not based on the delay time.</p>
