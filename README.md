# JavaScript Blog

This project is a simple blog page created to explain fundamental JavaScript topics related to asynchronous programming. It includes explanations of key concepts like **JavaScript Async**, **Callbacks**, **Promises**, **Async/Await**, and the **Event Loop**. The blog is designed to be visually appealing, with a fixed navigation bar, clean layout, and interactive code examples.


## Features

- **Navigation Bar**: On the left, there's a fixed navigation bar (`<aside>`), allowing users to quickly jump to different sections of the blog, including:
  - JavaScript Async
  - Callbacks
  - Promises
  - Async/Await
  - Event Loop
- **Interactive Code Examples**: Each section includes code examples that are highlighted using the `Prism.js` library for syntax highlighting. This improves readability and user interaction.
- **Responsive Design**: The page is designed to be responsive, adapting to different screen sizes with ease.
- **Dark Theme**: A dark-themed design using shades of black and blue to provide a clean and focused reading experience.

## File Structure

The project consists of the following files:

- `index.html`: The main HTML file that structures the blog content and links to the external stylesheet and JavaScript libraries.
- `styles.css`: The CSS file that styles the blog's layout, colors, and fonts.
- `prism.min.js` and `prism-tomorrow.min.css`: These files are loaded via CDN to enable syntax highlighting for JavaScript code examples in the blog.
